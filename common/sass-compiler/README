A pure Java implementation of the http://sass-lang.com compiler

This project has previously a part of the Vaadin Framework

Roadmap
=======
Sass Compiler 1.0 
* Compatibility with sass-lang compiler 3.2.12

Sass Compiler 1.1
* Compatibility with sass-lang compiler 3.3.0

Import the project into Eclipse
=============================

To get the project working in Eclipse you need to install the M2E connector
for JavaCC, found at (update site):
http://objectledge.github.com/maven-extensions/connectors/updates/development

After that you can import the project into Eclipse as a standard Maven
project

Building the project
====================
Running

  mvn package

will compile the project and run all tests


Tests
=====
There is an extensive test suite consisting of source scss input and expected 
css output imported from the sass-lang project. Today the features required by
the tests in src/test/resources/sasslang are fully implemented while the
tests in src/test/resources/sasslangbroken are currently expected to fail.
When reaching 1.0 the sasslangbroken package should no longer exist.

Contributing
=============
Your contributions are more than welcome. Please read
https://vaadin.com/contribute for more information on practicalities.
Because we are using Gerrit we cannot accept pull requests in GitHub.

Changes
=======

Version 0.9.12
--------------
It is now possible to specify how URLs appearing in an imported scss style
sheet are interpreted. The supported modes are absolute, mixed and
relative. For example, suppose that a root style sheet styles.scss imports
common/base.scss and base.scss contains the property definition

background-image: url(image.png);

In absolute mode the url will appear as url(image.png) also in the CSS
output. In relative and mixed mode it will be output as url(common/image.png).
The difference between mixed and relative mode is that in the mixed mode
a url is only modified if it appears in a property, whereas in the relative
mode the modification also takes place e.g. in variable definitions and
default values of mixin or function parameters.

Absolute mode can be used for compatibility with the sass-lang compiler.
For compiling the themes provided with Vaadin mixed or relative mode should
be used. Mixed mode is the default and was used in previous versions of
the compiler. For instructions on specifying the url mode from the command
line, run SassCompiler with no parameters.
