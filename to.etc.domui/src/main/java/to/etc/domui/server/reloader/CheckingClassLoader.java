/**
 * This ClassLoader is used to load classes that are not to be reloaded but which must
 * cause the classes <b>they</b> load to pass thru the checking mechanism. Classes loaded
 * by this class have their classloader set to this class, and every time such a class
 * needs another class that other class passes thru the "must I reload this class" check
 * too.
 * Classes loaded by this loader are not discarded; the classloader exists only to
 * force other classloads thru a check.
 * <p>This classloader loads classes as follows:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>If a class is already known we're done</li>
 * 	<li>If a class is part of the system (java.*, javax.*) we load thru a system loader always</li>
 * 	<li>All other classes are checked against the inclusion/exclusion patterns.</li>
 * 	<li>Excluded classes are loaded thru this classloader, so classes they load can be checked.</li>
 * 	<li>Included classes are loaded thru the DISCARDABLE classloader.</li>
 * </ul>
